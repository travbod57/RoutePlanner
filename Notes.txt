-- markers are positioned in front of other markers the lower down on the canvas they appear. 
The bug was that the makers higher up the canvas had their label text in front of the marker that was lower down the canvas. To solve this a manual change was made to this file:

Find and replace: overlayImage.appendChild(this.labelDiv_) with markerLayer.appendChild(this.labelDiv_). There should be one occurance.
